As the web has matured, we've gained consistency and usability, but sometimes at the cost of that original creative spirit. This post explores how we can bring back some of that weirdness while maintaining modern best practices."

While these tools offer efficiency and consistency, there's still value in understanding and writing custom CSS. This post discusses the benefits of handcrafted CSS and when it might be the right approach for your project."
