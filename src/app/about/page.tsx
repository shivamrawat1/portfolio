                    I'm a designer and developer focused on creating unique digital experiences.
                    My work spans web development, illustration, and CSS experimentation.

                    I believe the web should be a place for creativity and personal expression.
                    My projects aim to push boundaries while maintaining usability and accessibility.

                    When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me exploring new art techniques,
                    reading about design history, or experimenting with new web technologies.
